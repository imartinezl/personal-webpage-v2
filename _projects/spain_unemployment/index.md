Observatory of the unemployment in Spain, which is available to the public [here](https://imartinezl.shinyapps.io/spain-unemployment/), hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). This project attempts to bring the data of unemployment in Spain to the public in an accesible and understandable format. The unemployment data is presented through the prism of municipalities (cities & towns). I believe that people assimilate information much better if the data concerns them closely. At national level or even at county level, it is more difficult to grasp the scale and the meaning of the numbers.
