[dBizi](https://www.dbizi.com/) is the public electric bicycle loan service in the city of San Sebastian, Spain. Currently, dBizi users can know in real time, with a frequency of 5-6 minutes, the availability of bicycles in the 16 stations of the city. This information does not guarantee the user to have bicycles in their departure station, given the influx of users at certain times. In the same way, it is possible that the user finds himself without available bases in which to park his bicycle. <br>
[dBizi++](https://dbizi-project.firebaseapp.com/) is presented as an application for consultation and planning of bicycle trips with dBizi. This service uses available bicycle data in order to guarantee the availability of the service at all times, and for all users. The application informs the user of the viability of their journey, using historical data and in real time. <br>
The project is intended for dBizi users as well as for the maintenance of the bicycle system. This extension of the dBizi service allows users to estimate if they will have bicycles when they arrive at their departure station and if, given a destination station, they will have free bases to park their bicycles. Likewise, the information entered by the user in the application will allow the maintainer to know in advance the possible trips of the users and plan actions to guarantee the availability of bicycles and free bases.
