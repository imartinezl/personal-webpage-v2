  abstract = 	 {Time series alignment methods call for highly expressive, differentiable and invertible warping functions which preserve temporal topology, i.e diffeomorphisms. Diffeomorphic warping functions can be generated from the integration of velocity fields governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Gradient-based optimization frameworks containing diffeomorphic transformations require to calculate derivatives to the differential equation’s solution with respect to the model parameters, i.e. sensitivity analysis. Unfortunately, deep learning frameworks typically lack automatic-differentiation-compatible sensitivity analysis methods; and implicit functions, such as the solution of ODE, require particular care. Current solutions appeal to adjoint sensitivity methods, ad-hoc numerical solvers or ResNet’s Eulerian discretization. In this work, we present a closed-form expression for the ODE solution and its gradient under continuous piecewise-affine (CPA) velocity functions. We present a highly optimized implementation of the results on CPU and GPU. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets to validate the generalization ability of our model to unseen data for time-series joint alignment. Results show significant improvements both in terms of efficiency and accuracy.}

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing a global pandemic in 2020, is predominantly transmitted via airborne aerosols in indoor environments. This calls for novel strategies when assessing and controlling a building’s indoor air quality (IAQ). IAQ can generally be controlled by ventilation and/or policies to regulate human–building-interaction. However, in a building, occupants use rooms in different ways, and it may not be obvious which measure or combination of measures leads to a cost- and energy-effective solution ensuring good IAQ across the entire building. Therefore, in this article, we introduce a novel agent-based simulator, ArchABM, designed to assist in creating new or adapt existing buildings by estimating adequate room sizes, ventilation parameters and testing the effect of policies while taking into account IAQ as a result of complex human–building interaction patterns. A recently published aerosol model was adapted to calculate time-dependent carbon dioxide (CO2) and virus quanta concentrations in each room and inhaled CO2 and virus quanta for each occupant over a day as a measure of physiological response. ArchABM is flexible regarding the aerosol model and the building layout due to its modular architecture, which allows implementing further models, any number and size of rooms, agents, and actions reflecting human–building interaction patterns. We present a use case based on a real floor plan and working schedules adopted in our research center. This study demonstrates how advanced simulation tools can contribute to improving IAQ across a building, thereby ensuring a healthy indoor environment.}

abstract = {Accurate temperature measurements are essential for the proper monitoring and control of industrial furnaces. However, measurement uncertainty is a risk for such a critical parameter. Certain instrumental and environmental errors must be considered when using spectral-band radiation thermometry techniques, such as the uncertainty in the emissivity of the target surface, reflected radiation from surrounding objects, or atmospheric absorption and emission, to name a few. Undesired contributions to measured radiation can be isolated using measurement models, also known as error-correction models. This paper presents a methodology for budgeting significant sources of error and uncertainty during temperature measurements in a petrochemical furnace scenario. A continuous monitoring system is also presented, aided by a deep-learning-based measurement correction model, to allow domain experts to analyze the furnace’s operation in real-time. To validate the proposed system’s functionality, a real-world application case in a petrochemical plant is presented. The proposed solution demonstrates the viability of precise industrial furnace monitoring, thereby increasing operational security and improving the efficiency of such energy-intensive systems.}

abstract = {As society faces global challenges such as population growth and climate change, rethinking cities is now more imperative than ever. The design of cities can not be abstracted from the design of their mobility systems. Therefore, efficient solutions must be found to transport people and goods throughout the city efficiently and ecologically. An autonomous bicycle-sharing system would combine the most relevant benefits of vehicle-sharing, autonomy, and micro-mobility, increasing the efficiency and convenience of bicycle-sharing systems and incentivizing more people to bike and enjoy their cities in an environmentally friendly way. Due to the novelty of introducing autonomous driving technology into bicycle-sharing systems and their inherent complexity, there is a need to quantify the potential impact of autonomy on fleet performance and user experience. This paper presents the results of an agent-based simulation that provides an in-depth understanding of the fleet behavior of autonomous bicycle-sharing systems in realistic scenarios, including a rebalancing system based on demand prediction. In addition, this work describes the impact of different parameters on system efficiency and service quality. Finally, it quantifies the extent to which an autonomous system would outperform current station-based and dockless bicycle-sharing schemes. The obtained results show that with a fleet size three and a half times smaller than a station-based system and eight times smaller than a dockless system, an autonomous system can improve overall performance and user experience even with no rebalancing.}

abstract = {Fast urbanization and climate change require innovative systems for an efficient movement of people and goods in cities. As trends towards vehicle-sharing, autonomous vehicles, and the use of micro-mobility systems gain strength, the intersection of these fields appears as an area of great opportunity. Autonomy could potentially bring the convenience of on-demand mobility into already prevalent shared micro-mobility systems (SMMS), increasing their efficiency and incentivizing more people to use active mobility modes. The novelty of introducing autonomous driving technology into SMMS and their inherent complexity requires tools to assess and quantify the potential impact of autonomy on fleet performance and user experience. This paper presents an ad-hoc agent-based simulator for the assessment of the fleet behavior of autonomous SMMS in realistic scenarios, including a rebalancing system based on demand prediction. It also allows comparing its performance to station-based and dockless schemes. The proposed simulation framework is highly configurable and flexible and works with high resolution and precision geospatial data. The results of studies carried out with this simulation tool could provide valuable insights for many stakeholders, including vehicle design engineers, fleet operators, city planners, and governments.}

abstract = {In the operation & maintenance (O&M) of photovoltaic (PV) plants, the early identification of failures has become crucial to maintain productivity and prolong components’ life. Of all defects, cell-level anomalies can lead to serious failures and may affect surrounding PV modules in the long run. These fine defects are usually captured with high spatial resolution electroluminescence (EL) imaging. The difficulty of acquiring such images has limited the availability of data. For this work, multiple data resources and augmentation techniques have been used to surpass this limitation. Current state-of-the-art detection methods extract barely low-level information from individual PV cell images, and their performance is conditioned by the available training data. In this article, we propose an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that detects, locates and segments cell-level anomalies from entire photovoltaic modules via EL images. The proposed modular pipeline combines three deep learning techniques: 1. object detection (modified Faster-RNN), 2. image classification (EfficientNet) and 3. weakly supervised segmentation (autoencoder). The modular nature of the pipeline allows to upgrade the deep learning models to the further improvements in the state-of-the-art and also extend the pipeline towards new functionalities.}

abstract = {Data science has employed great research efforts in developing advanced analytics, improving data models and cultivating new algorithms. However, not many authors have come across the organizational and socio-technical challenges that arise when executing a data science project: lack of vision and clear objectives, a biased emphasis on technical issues, a low level of maturity for ad-hoc projects and the ambiguity of roles in data science are among these challenges. Few methodologies have been proposed on the literature that tackle these type of challenges, some of them date back to the mid-1990, and consequently they are not updated to the current paradigm and the latest developments in big data and machine learning technologies. In addition, fewer methodologies offer a complete guideline across team, project and data & information management. In this article we would like to explore the necessity of developing a more holistic approach for carrying out data science projects. We first review methodologies that have been presented on the literature to work on data science projects and classify them according to the their focus: project, team, data and information management. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework containing general characteristics that a methodology for managing data science projects with a holistic point of view should have. This framework can be used by other researchers as a roadmap for the design of new data science methodologies or the updating of existing ones.}

abstract="A failure detection system is the first step towards predictive maintenance strategies. A popular data-driven method to detect incipient failures and anomalies is the training of normal behaviour models by applying a machine learning technique like feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or extreme learning machines (ELM). However, the performance of any of these modelling techniques can be deteriorated by the unexpected rise of non-stationarities in the dynamic environment in which industrial assets operate. This unpredictable statistical change in the measured variable is known as concept drift. In this article a wind turbine maintenance case is presented, where non-stationarities of various kinds can happen unexpectedly. Such concept drift events are desired to be detected by means of statistical detectors and window-based approaches. However, in real complex systems, concept drifts are not as clear and evident as in artificially generated datasets. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of current drift detectors and also to design an appropriate novel technique for this specific industrial application, it is essential to dispose beforehand of a characterization of the existent drifts. Under the lack of information in this regard, a methodology for labelling concept drift events in the lifetime of wind turbines is proposed. This methodology will facilitate the creation of a drift database that will serve both as a training ground for concept drift detectors and as a valuable information to enhance the knowledge about maintenance of complex systems.",
